              <h3>Reducing Systemic UX Risk in a Legacy Platform</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, I focused on identifying and reducing systemic
                UX risks in a long-lived platform, balancing accessibility,
                structural stability, and ongoing product demands.

              <h4>Section 1: Context & Platform Reality</h4>
              <p>
                The platform is a decade-old SaaS used daily by Powersports and
                Motorcycle Dealerships to manage leads, sales, inventory,
                accounting, and marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, the product expanded feature-by-feature without a
                unified design or front-end foundation. While the system
                remained functional, this growth introduced hidden complexity
                that affected development speed, UX consistency, and long-term
                scalability.
              </p>
              <p>
                The challenge was not a failing product, but a mature platform
                carrying accumulated design and technical decisions, where small
                changes increasingly created outsized risk.

              <h4>Section 2: UX Audit - Identifying Systemic Risks</h4>
              <p>
                As the platform evolved over more than a decade, UX and
                front-end Technical Debt accumulated quietly. While
                functionality remained intact, system-level risks began to
                surface through inconsistency, fragility, and reduced
                development efficiency.

            <div class="block">
              <h5>UI Inconsistency</h5>
              <p>
                The absence of a Design System led to fragmented visual
                patterns. Similar components were implemented multiple times
                with slight variations, increasing cognitive load and weakening
                user trust.
              </p>
              <h5>Fragile Front-End Structure</h5>
              <p>
                Deeply nested CSS, mixed selector practices, and inline styles
                made the UI difficult to maintain. Minor changes often caused
                unintended side effects, slowing iteration and increasing QA
                effort.
              </p>
              <h5>Development Bottlenecks</h5>
              <p>
                Developers spent excessive time navigating legacy code instead
                of delivering improvements. This indirectly impacted UX through
                delayed features and performance complaints.
              </p>
              <h5>Accessibility and Responsiveness Gaps</h5>
              <p>
                Inconsistent accessibility and limited mobile support created
                compliance and usability risks, particularly in regulated
                markets and non-desktop use cases.
              </p>
              <h5>Audit Summary</h5>
              <p>
                The platform’s challenges were not isolated UI issues, but
                compounding systemic risks. Without structural intervention,
                future changes would become slower, riskier, and more costly.

              <h4>Section 3: Strategic UX Direction</h4>
              <p>
                Following the audit, the core question was not what to redesign,
                but where to intervene first to reduce risk without stopping
                product delivery.

              <h6>I. Context</h6>
              <p>
                The platform had accumulated UX and front-end Technical Debt,
                but ongoing business demands required continuous feature
                delivery.

                  Address high-risk UX gaps while gradually stabilizing the
                  system
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>III. Decision</h6>
              <p>
                I prioritized Accessibility and Responsive improvements as the
                first intervention.

              <h6>IV. Rationale</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Accessibility issues carried immediate legal and compliance
                  risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Responsive gaps affected real operational use cases,
                  especially quick mobile tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improvements in these areas forced early standardization of
                  layout, structure, and semantic HTML. Laying groundwork for
                  system stability without blocking delivery.

              <h6>I. Context</h6>
              <p>
                A full Design System and CSS cleanup could not be treated as a

              <h6>II. Decision</h6>
              <p>
                Instead of a big-bang refactor, system improvements were
                introduced progressively, embedded within ongoing feature
                development and maintenance work.

                <li>
                  System decisions were validated against real use cases rather

                <li>
                  Each feature contributed back to system consistency, rather
                  than adding new fragmentation.

                This strategy allowed the platform to reduce systemic UX risks
                while continuing to deliver business value. System stability was

              <h6>I. Problem Addressed</h6>
              <p>
                The existing CSS structure was fragile, tightly coupled, and
                prone to side effects.
              </p>
              <h6>II. Intervention</h6>
              <p>
                Design decisions were translated directly into code standards.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Introduced SASS variables to centralize visual tokens</li>
                <li>
                  Standardized naming conventions and reduced deep selector

              <h5>System Stabilization Through Progressive Adoption</h5>
              <p>
                The Design System was not enforced all at once. Adoption
                happened progressively as features were updated or introduced.
              </p>
              <p>This approach ensured:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>System rules were validated by real use cases</li>
                <li>
                  Legacy constraints were respected without blocking progress
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consistency increased over time instead of regressing with
                  each new feature

              <h5>Outcome</h5>
              <p>
                The platform shifted from ad-hoc UI decisions to a more
                predictable and maintainable system. Design consistency
                improved, front-end changes became safer to implement, and

              <p>
                As systemic risks were reduced through accessibility,
                responsive, and structural improvements, the platform gained the
                flexibility to address high-impact user problems without

              <h6>I. Problem Addressed</h6>
              <p>
                Dealers struggled to meet customer demand when specific units
                were out of stock, while slow-moving inventory remained unsold

              <h6>III. Solution</h6>
              <p>
                A dealer-to-dealer inventory search was introduced, allowing
                dealers to discover available units beyond their own inventory.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Privacy controls enabled dealers to define what data was

                </li>
                <li>
                  Search scope and visibility were clearly communicated to

                </li>
                <li>
                  Data integrity was enforced by limiting results to official

                These UX improvements were not isolated feature builds. They
                were enabled by earlier efforts to stabilize layout structure,
                accessibility patterns, and front-end conventions. By operating
                within emerging system constraints, each feature reinforced
                consistency rather than adding new exceptions.

              <h4>Section 7: Outcomes & Observed Impact</h4>
              <p>
                While not all outcomes were captured through quantitative
                metrics, the changes resulted in clear, observable improvements
                in how the platform was designed, built, and evolved over time.
              </p>
              <h5>Increased System Predictability</h5>
              <p>
                Design and front-end decisions became more consistent and easier
                to reason about. Shared patterns and constraints reduced
                ambiguity, allowing teams to move forward with greater
                confidence and fewer unintended side effects.
              </p>
              <h5>Safer and Faster Iteration</h5>
              <p>
                Incremental changes were less likely to break unrelated areas.
                QA cycles became more focused, and UX improvements could be
                introduced with reduced risk compared to earlier stages of the
                platform.
              </p>
              <h5>Reduced Compliance and Operational Risk</h5>
              <p>
                Achieving WCAG Level AA alignment addressed accessibility gaps
                that previously posed legal and usability risks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Responsive improvements expanded practical usability without
                introducing unnecessary complexity.
              </p>
              <h5>Clearer UX Trade-Offs</h5>
              <p>
                UX decisions shifted from reactive fixes to intentional
                trade-offs. Limitations, such as “good enough” mobile
                experiences for non-core use cases, were explicitly defined,
                documented, and aligned with real usage context.
              </p>
              <h5>Stronger Foundation for Future Work</h5>
              <p>
                Rather than locking the team into rigid solutions, the platform
                gained a more stable baseline that future features and
                improvements could build upon incrementally.

              <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
              <p>
                This project reinforced how UX problems in long-lived platforms
                rarely exist in isolation. Most issues were symptoms of deeper
                systemic instability rather than isolated design flaws.
              </p>
              <h5>UX as Risk Management</h5>
              <p>
                UX work was most effective when framed as risk reduction, not
                just visual improvement. Addressing accessibility,
                responsiveness, and structural consistency early helped prevent
                larger issues from compounding over time.
              </p>
              <h5>Systems Over Screens</h5>
              <p>
                Improving individual screens had limited value without
                stabilizing the underlying system. Design Systems and front-end
                structure became tools to support safer decisions, not just
                faster delivery.
              </p>
              <h5>Progress Over Perfection</h5>
              <p>
                Stability was built incrementally, alongside real product
                demands. Practical constraints and trade-offs were acknowledged
                rather than avoided, resulting in solutions that could be
                sustained.
              </p>
              <h5>Design as a Bridge</h5>
              <p>
                The work sat at the intersection of user needs, technical
                constraints, and business risk. Bridging these perspectives
                enabled UX decisions that were realistic, defensible, and
                aligned with long-term platform health.

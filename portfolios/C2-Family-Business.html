              <h4>The Challenge: Managing a Business Without Clear Data</h4>
              <p><b>Role: </b>Project Lead & Developer (Low-code)</p>
              <p><b>Stack: </b>Google AppSheet, Google Sheets</p>
              <p>
                My family’s garden and landscaping supply shop has been a stable
                business for years. However, it relied entirely on manual paper
                records and the manager's intuition. When I joined, I noticed a
                few areas that could be improved.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Intuition over Data: </b>Procurement was based on
                  "eyeballing" stock levels rather than actual sales data,
                  leading to frequent out-of-stock scenarios and missed sales
                  opportunities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The Owner’s Dependency: </b>To know what was happening in
                  the shop, an owner or manager had to be physically present.
                  There was no way to check sales or stock levels from outside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Unusable Data: </b> Unusable Data: While daily sales were
                  recorded on paper, making it very hard to analyze which
                  products drove the best cash flow or profit margins.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>The Strategy: A Simple Digital Tool, Low-Code Approach</h5>
              <p>
                I decided to build a
                <b>custom POS (Point of Sale) solution </b>using
                <b>AppSheet</b>. This allowed me to prioritize two things:
                Cost-efficiency and Ease of Use (UX) for a non-technical
                workforce.
              </p>

              <h4>I. Step-by-Step Improvements</h4>
              <p>
                I didn't change everything at once. I divided the work into two
                phases to make it easier for the team:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Phase 1 (Core Operations): </b>Digital Product Catalog,
                  PO/SO Management, and Daily/Monthly Summaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Phase 2 (Optimization): </b>Low-stock alerts, Staff
                  Attendance & Payroll calculation, and Digital Invoicing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h4>II. Helping the Team Adapt</h4>
              <p>
                The biggest goal was to make sure the staff felt comfortable
                using the new tool. I used a few simple strategies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Familiar Form Factor: </b>Since the staff already used
                  smartphones, a tablet felt more natural to them than a
                  computer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Clean and Simple Design: </b>I designed a "Clean UI" I only
                  showed the buttons and information they absolutely needed
                  based on their roles (Admin vs. Sales). This made the app easy
                  to learn and reduced mistakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Focus on Benefits: </b>I framed the system not as a
                  "monitoring tool," but as a "helper" that saved them from
                  doing long manual calculations at the end of each day.
                </li>
              </ul>

                The Result: Real-time Remote Oversight & Data-Driven Growth
              </h4>
              <p>
                The transformation has moved the business from a traditional
                shop to a modern, scalable, and data-driven operation that I can
                now monitor from anywhere.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Remote Tracking: </b>I can now see real-time sales and
                  stock levels from my phone, even when I'm not at the shop.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Accurate Inventory: </b>By tracking sales digitally, we
                  reduced stock mistakes to less than 2%, despite dealing with
                  non-barcoded items (like clay pots and soil).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Role-Based Access Control: </b>Implemented security layers
                  to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access to
                  sensitive financial records.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Better Decisions: </b>We now have a clear list of what
                  sells best. We no longer guess what to buy, but use the data to
                  make smarter choices for the business.

              <h4>Personal Takeaway</h4>
              <p>
                This project was a masterclass in Pragmatic Problem Solving. It
                taught me that Digital Transformation doesn't have to be
                complicated or expensive. It’s about understanding the real
                problems of a business and creating a tool that people enjoy
                using and managing the transition with empathy and strategy. By
                building this system, I’ve made the business more stable and
                gained back my time to pursue new opportunities.

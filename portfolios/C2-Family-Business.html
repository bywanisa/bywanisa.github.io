              <h4>Context & Constraints</h4>
              <p>
                This project was conducted in a small, family-owned garden and
                landscaping supply shop operating with highly traditional,
                paper-based processes. The business had remained stable for
                years, but daily operations relied heavily on manual records and
                on-the-spot judgment rather than accessible data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only two front-of-house staff interacted directly with
                operational systems. Sales staff at the counter, one of whom
                also acted as the store manager responsible for procurement,
                attendance tracking, and payroll calculations. The rest of the
                workforce consisted of labor-based roles with no system
                interaction, reinforcing the need for a simple and clearly
                scoped solution.
              </p>
              <p>Several constraints defined the problem space:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>SME scale with limited budget</b>, ruling out enterprise
                  POS systems or long-term custom development
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Low technical confidence</b>, among system users,
                  increasing the risk of resistance and errors
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-standard inventory</b>, including items without
                  barcodes or consistent SKUs
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Business continuity requirements</b>, where daily
                  operations could not be disrupted for transformation
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Rather than treating these as limitations to overcome, I
                approached them as design constraints that shaped every decision
                by anchoring the solution in practicality, clarity, and
                long-term usability.

              <h4>Problem Framing</h4>
              <p>
                Initial issues appeared operational such as frequent stock
                shortages, time-consuming end-of-day summaries, and limited
                visibility into sales performance unless someone was physically
                present at the shop.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, closer observation revealed that these were only
                surface-level symptoms.
              </p>
              <h6>
                The core problem was not the absence of tools, but the absence
                of a shared source of truth.
              </h6>
              <p>
                Sales data existed only on paper, making it costly to aggregate
                and nearly impossible to analyze. Stock decisions relied on
                visual estimation, while payroll and attendance summaries
                required manual calculations twice a month. As a result,
                decisions were delayed, inconsistent, and heavily dependent on
                individual experience.
              </p>
              <p>From a stakeholder perspective, the pain points differed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Owner: </b>Limited real-time visibility and reliance on
                  intuition for procurement decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Front-of-house staff: </b>Repetitive calculations, fear of
                  making irreversible mistakes, and low confidence in digital
                  tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Business: </b>Missed sales opportunities, inefficient
                  purchasing, and no clear understanding of which products drove
                  cash flow.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Reframing the problem around data trust rather than software
                implementation, shifted the goal from “digitizing records” to
                enabling confident, data-informed decisions across daily
                operations.

              <h4>Decision & Trade-offs</h4>
              <p>
                All key decisions in this project were shaped by the scale of
                the business and the realities of a traditional SME environment.
                The goal was not to implement the most advanced system, but the
                most appropriate one.

              <h5>Platform choice: Low-code over enterprise or custom build</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Off-the-shelf POS systems were cost-prohibitive and assumed
                  standardized inventory and high technical readiness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fully custom development offered flexibility but exceeded the
                  business’s time and maintenance capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A low-code approach (Google AppSheet + Google Sheets) was
                  chosen to prioritize affordability, fast iteration, and
                  adaptability.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Speed of iteration over UI perfection</h5>
              <p>
                Using a low-code platform limited fine-grained UI control. This
                trade-off was accepted to enable rapid changes based on real
                usage, which mattered more than pixel-perfect interfaces in this
                context.
              </p>
              <h5>Tablet-first interaction model</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tablets aligned better with existing staff behavior and
                  physical workspace at the counter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The decision minimized behavioral change and reduced anxiety
                  among low-tech users.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Role-based access instead of feature-rich screens</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Only two front-of-house staff interacted with the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Interfaces were scoped by role to reduce cognitive load and
                  error risk.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Deferred optimization by design</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Automation features (alerts, payroll, attendance) were
                  intentionally postponed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Establishing trust in daily data entry was prioritized over
                  early efficiency gains.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Across these trade-offs, decisions consistently favored clarity,
                stability, and adoption over technical sophistication or
                theoretical scalability.

              <h4>Execution & Iteration</h4>
              <p>
                Execution was designed as a gradual transition rather than a
                full system rollout. Adoption, not deployment, was treated as
                the primary success metric.

              <p>
                Responsibilities were expanded only after usage became habitual
                and data reliability was established.
              </p>
              <h5>Progressive access over immediate automation</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>PO creation was initially restricted to the owner</li>
                <li>
                  Access was expanded once confidence and accuracy improved
                </li>
                <li>
                  Automation features were deliberately deferred to avoid
                  amplifying early errors
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Iteration through observation</h5>
              <p>
                Instead of formal training or documentation, iteration was
                driven by direct observation of daily workflows. Friction points
                were addressed by simplifying inputs and aligning screen flow
                with real counter behavior.
              </p>
              <h5>Change management through framing</h5>
              <p>
                The system was consistently positioned as a tool to reduce
                repetitive work, not as a monitoring mechanism. This framing
                played a key role in reducing resistance among low-tech users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout execution, my role focused on facilitation and
                decision-making, ensuring that technical complexity never
                exceeded what the team and business could realistically support.

                The impact of the system extended beyond operational efficiency.
                Its primary value lay in improving decision quality and reducing
                uncertainty across daily operations.

            <div class="block">
              <h5>Improved data reliability and visibility</h5>
              <p>
                Sales and stock information became accessible in near real time,
                enabling remote visibility without requiring physical presence
                at the shop. Inventory discrepancies were reduced to under 3%,
                despite the absence of barcodes or standardized SKUs.
              </p>
              <h5>Meaningful time savings in routine work</h5>
              <p>
                Manual end-of-day sales summaries, which previously took
                approximately 30 minutes, were significantly reduced. Payroll
                and attendance calculations once requiring about one hour per
                cycle were simplified through structured data and basic
                automation.
              </p>
              <h5>
                Shift from intuition-driven to evidence-informed decisions
              </h5>
              <p>
                Procurement decisions were no longer based on visual estimation
                alone. Historical sales data provided a clearer understanding of
                product performance and cash flow contributors, allowing
                purchasing decisions to be made with greater confidence and
                consistency.
              </p>
              <h5>Increased staff confidence and system trust</h5>
              <p>
                As the system matured, staff hesitation toward digital tools
                diminished. Role-based access and progressive responsibility
                helped reduce fear of irreversible mistakes, replacing avoidance
                with routine use and ownership.
              </p>
              <h5>Stronger operational governance</h5>
              <p>
                Role-based access controls improved data integrity and protected
                sensitive financial information. Decision-making became less
                dependent on individuals and more grounded in shared, reliable
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the system shifted the business from reactive
                operations toward a more stable, data-informed mode of
                management without increasing technical or cognitive burden on
                the team.

              <h4>Reflection as a Practitioner</h4>
              <p>
                This project reinforced my belief that effective UX is rarely
                about interfaces alone. In environments with limited resources
                and low technical confidence, the real challenge lies in
                designing systems that people trust enough to use consistently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working in a constrained SME context, I experienced product
                ownership not as feature delivery, but as continuous
                decision-making. Wearing multiple hats as facilitator,
                decision-maker, and builder, highlighted the importance of
                sequencing, scope control, and timing over technical ambition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rather than pursuing feature completeness or visual refinement,
                I focused on reducing cognitive load, managing risk, and
                building confidence through progressive change. Decisions such
                as limiting access, deferring automation, and simplifying inputs
                were intentional UX choices, designed to support real behavior,
                not ideal workflows.
              </p>
              <p>
                Progress came not from building more features, but from asking
                the right questions at the right time:<br />
                <i
                  >What is safe to change now? What should wait? And what level
                  of accuracy is “good enough” to move forward?</i
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                From an optimization perspective, the most valuable outcome was
                not efficiency, but reliability. Once data became trustworthy,
                better decisions followed naturally. By grounding decisions in
                observed behavior and operational realities, I was able to
                introduce change without disrupting daily work.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience shaped how I approach complex systems,
                prioritizing clarity over sophistication, people over processes,
                and long-term usability over short-term wins. It also
                strengthened my interest in roles that sit at the intersection
                of business, users, and systems, where value is created not by
                building more, but by deciding better.

              <ul>
                <li>Adoption is a design problem, not a training problem</li>
